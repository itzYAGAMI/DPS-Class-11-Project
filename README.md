Synopsis for Distraction Blocker Project 

Objective 

The project aims to develop a distraction blocker application that enhances focus and productivity by restricting access to distracting websites and applications. The program provides multiple modes to cater to different focus needs and includes features for scheduling and saving user preferences. 

 

Features 

  Basic Mode: 
    Blocks specified distractions with password-protected settings. 
    Users can stop or modify the block anytime using the password. 

  Ultra Focus Mode: 
    Once activated, the program cannot be stopped until timer finishes 
    Even after a system reboot, the block remains active. 

  Pomodoro Mode: 
    Operates on the 25-5 minute cycle (25 minutes of focus, 5 minutes of break). 
    Automatically alternates between blocking and unblocking distractions. 

  Absolute 0 Distractions Mode: 
    Immediately locks the screen after activation. 
    Automatically relocks the screen if the user logs back in until the time limit expires. 

  Save Block Settings: 
    Enables saving frequently used block lists for quick reuse. 
    Allows scheduling specific settings to activate automatically at designated times. 

  Scheduling Options:  
    Users can define time periods (e.g., daily from 7 PM to 9 PM) when the blocker will activate automatically. 

 

 

Technologies Involved 

   Python for the main application logic 

   Windows Scheduler/Task Automation for scheduling.
